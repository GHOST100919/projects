                Lamborghini is one of the world's most iconic luxury sports car brands, but it began in an unexpected place—on a farm. <br>
                Founded in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, a successful tractor manufacturer, the company was born out of his frustration with <br>
                Ferrari’s customer service. Determined to build a better grand tourer, he launched Automobili Lamborghini in Sant’Agata Bolognese, <br>
                Italy.The brand gained early fame with the Miura in 1966, a revolutionary mid-engine supercar that set new standards in design and <br>
                performance. However, the 1973 oil crisis and financial struggles forced Ferruccio to sell the company, which changed hands several times <br>
                over the years.Lamborghini found new life in 1998 when it was acquired by Audi (Volkswagen Group). Backed by German engineering, the company <br>
                introduced modern classics like the Murciélago, Gallardo, Aventador, and Huracán. In 2018, it launched the Urus, a high-performance SUV, expanding <br>
                its reach.In 2023, Lamborghini entered the hybrid era with the Revuelto, combining electrification with its signature V12 power.From tractors to world-class <br>
                supercars, Lamborghini's journey is one of passion, innovation, and relentless pursuit of performance.
